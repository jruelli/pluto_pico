 * @brief Relay Control Module
 *
 * This module provides a set of functions for controlling and querying the state
 * of relay modules in an embedded system. It includes capabilities to set the state
 * of individual relays or all relays simultaneously, retrieve the current state of
 * any relay, and interact with the relay module through a command-line interface.
 * The functions make use of GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pins to manage
 * the relay states.
 *
 * This module facilitates the integration of relay control into larger systems,
 * allowing for effective management of power and signal control through relays.
 * It is designed to be easy to use and integrate into various embedded systems
 * requiring relay control functionality.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Setting the state of individual or multiple relays.
 * - Querying the state of any relay.
 * - Command-line interface for relay control.
 * - Initialization and configuration of relay GPIO pins.
 *
 * The module is a part of a larger system and can be utilized in applications such
 * as home automation, industrial control, and other scenarios where relay control
 * is essential.
